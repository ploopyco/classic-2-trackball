# Appendix C: Hardware

# Buying hardware from us

Getting all of the hardware on your own can be tricky because the parts you select may not fit perfectly. [That's why we sell kits with everything you need to build a Ploopy Classic 2 Trackball](https://ploopy.co/product-category/classic-2/). Here's why that's great for you:

- Everything is guaranteed to fit together perfectly
- Everything is guaranteed to work as intended
- You'll end up saving money - probably quite a bit of money - by not spending on extra parts

Your call. You'll sort it out.

# Getting your own hardware

This guide was a bit light on detail in the other sections, and that's because the hardware has to conform to many specifications. They'll all be listed here.

First, a complete list of all the hardware you'll need:

- 6x screws
- 3x MR63ZZ roller bearings
- 2x 3mm x 18mm metal dowels
- 1x silicone ring
- 4x friction pads
- 1x snooker ball


We'll be going over all of them in detail. There will be mentions of *critical specifications*; if you're going to be sourcing your own parts, **you must get parts that conform to the critical specifications**. If you go off-menu, the parts will not fit the way that we intended when we designed the Classic 2. That might mean that your Classic 2 **doesn't work**.

Let's get cracking.
